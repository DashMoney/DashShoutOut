Test ideas -> 

Platform login vs Wallet login -> ?

User just sees a button on login screen -> use a div so one button on each side -> 
Questions -> does plat login use skipsync and how?
          -> or can it use offline mode? ->

    Need to disable the topup button if balance === 0, its a catch all <-

Question -> will the changing of skipsync cause the app to fail. I know that the console.log will yell about it.

What about removing adapter <- so won't affect.. -> Do It ->





TODO LIST - We at it again!!!

11) Persistanct issues
-> hit enter/return in create message errors BC textarea vice input has no onSubmit. and Regex kicks unless multiline


Much Success
-10) Top UP is connected but need to connect to App
            So I can disconnect the BottomNav when I send a message, refresh or Top up..... -> DONE!!

-9)MAJOR UPDATE WITH TESTNET FUNCTIONALITY
        -> What about a modal for the loading spinner so spins on top of everything?? -> LATER Possibly ->

-8) handle formatting -> 
        how to display Announcement correctly -> really probably just include a bootstrap badge that says "Announcement" ;)

        how to handle the order -> this should probably involve how the datacontract*** is created in the first place!!!!

-7) Query for DGT Followers -> DGT Make Announcement creates a dsomessage -> then the follower will query the DGT self invites and then query dso messages from each of the GroupNames but how will it not pick up all the DSOMessages from GroupOwner?? -> special tag -> @01 or something that is not a name??!!

-> Perhaps query should just be to dgtmessages but how to decern regular message from Announcement -> include in DGTDataContract??!!

->Announcement is its own doc? -> ??!!! -> this seems to make the most sense



-6) Had an idea -> something about removing something -> so people couldn't see order on Everyone -> But it may clutter but that is okay, the more the merrier, I say

-5) ToDo: a) fix tags for unique names and limit to 30NO 60Yes tags ->
                -> 60 why not should be hard to hit and not even limit.
                ->
          b) make the newmessage to implement lowercase and trigger  
            docs creation -> 
          c) Fix BottomNav buttons -> DONE

-4) Make List of what I could add in version 2:
        1) Local storage - probably
        2) Improved Data Contract -probably
                -> or introduce a verify function that runs in background
                    -> I think I will go with a check that uses the ownerId of each Document and then that will check if the dashUniqueName matches the ownerID/identityID (Im pretty sure those are the same)
                -> or fix the data contract -> i think the data contract has everything i need -> the other way would be that I don't include the name and then I just search the ownerId and retrieve the name but would that slow the presentation/display too much?
                    -> later if I wanted I could just implement the searchFirst because Document already has that too.
        3) Live Reload? -> probably no
        4) Tag yourself -> == Like ? -> maybe
        5) Reply or Link -> maybe
        6) search or filtering on everyone tab -> probably
        7) Load More -> add the bottom of page to pull older messages!

-3) Rip out the Mock up stuff.. -> DONE
    ->LandingPage Stuff -> DONE
    Remove the App.js mock up functions -> DONE
    
-2) Add a Topic Tag or # to the data Contract -WHY -> dont know -> so NO

    -> implement a local storage to track the "filter" or "Search DSO" 

        -> this will be a list in the Everyone? -> Version 2
        -> when you search it adds to list of messages so that two people talking back and forth can be seen.


-1) Make the buttons the same width! - Looks okay on mobile already.

0) Change DGT to DSO -> DONE

0ai) Make Bottom Nav -> 1 level -> DONE
    -> Fix expand nav function and -> DONE

0a) Incorporate the tag in the message to the users so can have multiple users tagged->
    ->and make them blue!-> Nope -> Just List below -> DONE
    -> update everything from receiving just one tag to an array -> DONE

    -> auto tag myself so that I only query once and that is it????*****
    -> because the tagging and the text are separate so hmmmm
    -> can I just user tags in document as lowercase and it work?
    -> works because I control the query and it is hackable/manipulatible

THIS ^^^ WORK ON ABOVE THAT IS NOT DONE YET ^^^^

    -> !!! have to implement a VERIFIER that checks the originator with the identity *********************************** 2ND VERSION
     -> This brings in many questions but it seems that everyone will have to validate the name to an identity unless like with DPNS and DAshPay maybe there is a validation
      -> Data Triggers??

//**************************************************************//
Combining Public Message Board and Personal Messager
//**************************************************************//

1) Complete Public Message Board - define the data contract and how to add comments or messages
  a) data contract ->
      DataContract (paste here)

  b) add comments (view) ability and ability to add to top of board!
    i)Modal? -> this way doesn't deviate from the top/bottom Nav flow but can I still view the page?
    ii) Offcanvas?
  c) New Message - Form - has to have check for more than one letter -> this will allow button to click
  also not more than so many characters will alert and disconnect button.

2) Complete Personal Messager - really it is an aggregator for messages that include the person in the messages
  a) Start with to a single person
  b) Allow multiple persons, use dashpay contacts or just separate by comma

3) Include reply ability and create threads -> no, out of scope - for now
